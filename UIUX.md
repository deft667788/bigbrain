I carefully designed the UI/UX for this Kahoot-like answer site to ensure that the user experience is simple, intuitive, and enjoyable. Here are the main things we did in UI/UX:

1. Clear layout and navigation: We designed a clean and clear layout for the website to make it easy for users to find the features they are looking for. The navigation bar clearly shows the main functions (such as create answer activities, join answer activities, view leaderboard, etc.), enabling users to quickly access the sections they are interested in.

2. Visual Style: We chose a modern and striking visual style, including a bright color scheme and an easy-to-read font. This visual style is designed to keep users pleasurable and engaged while providing a consistent user experience.

3. Responsive design: Our website is responsive, which means it can be displayed adaptively on different devices such as desktop, tablet, and mobile. This ensures that users get a consistent experience across devices.

4. Interactive Elements: We designed our interactive elements with a special focus on ease of use. Buttons and other interactive components have clear labels and functions that make it easy for users to understand how to operate. We also ensured adequate spacing and size to avoid false touches and improve the usability of touch devices.

5. Transitions: We used transitions throughout the site to provide a smooth experience for our users. It helps to make the answer process more lively and interesting.

6. Accessibility: We strive to make our website accessible to a variety of users. To this end, we focused on color contrast, font size, and using simple language. We also ensured that the keyboard navigation was friendly so that users who were unable to use a mouse or touch screen could easily access the site.

I believe that these efforts will help to provide a pleasant user experience, ensuring that our answer site is satisfied in terms of both functionality and ease of use
